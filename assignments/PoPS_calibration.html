Run each block in the provided R scripts step by step and see the associated instructions as comments in the code.

<h3>Calibration</h3>
Run the calibration code to derive parameters for spore rate and distance for the PoPs model. 
<ul>
<li>What are the parameters?</li>
<li>How many times were the spore rate and distance parameters used out of the total number of calibration iterations?</li>
<li>What does the distribution of the two parameters look like?</li>
</ul>

Optional:
<ul>
<li>Try different numbers of iterations. Are derived parameters different?</li>
<li>Try turning management on (line 22). Are derived parameters different?</li>
</ul>


<h3>Validation</h3>
Use the parameters derived from the calibration code to run the PoPS model and
validate the outputs using the validation code.
<ul>
<li>What was the average disagreement and landscape similarity?</li>
</ul>

Optional:
<ul>
<li>Try with management on (line 24). How are the total disagreement and landscape similarity affected?</li>
<li>Try with different spore rate and distance parameters. How are total disagreement and landscape similarity affected?</li>
<li>Try with different conditions. How are total disagreement and landscape similarity affected?
    <ul>
        <li>With mortality on - Set mortality to "TRUE" and you can change the
             conditions for time lag and mortality rate (lines 28-30)</li>
        <li>With wind direction on - Can set wind to "N", "S", "W", "E".
            Higher kappa values make the wind direction stronger (lines 33-34).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
