    <h3>Cellular automata principle</h3>
<p>
Space is tesselated into grid cells $(i,j)$ (usually square) with initial state $C_{i,j}^{t=0}$
<p>General expression for the cell state evolution:
<p>
$$
C_{ij}^{t+\Delta t} = F(C_{ij}^{t}, O_{ij}^{t}, R)
$$
<p>
State of cell $(i,j)$ at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of cells in its neighborhood $O_{ij}^{t}$
 <li>transition rules $R$
 <li>$\Delta t$ is small 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Game of life rules</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
</ul>
<p>
For the given rules, the resulting pattern is dependent only on the initial configuration:
example of <strong>emergence and self-organization </strong>

    <h3>Geospatial cellular automata</h3>
<ul>
  <li>initial state is based on land use / land cover data, usually from RS or GIS
  <li>rules are derived from socio-economic data and interactions between humans and environment 
  <li>models are calibrated and validated using time series of land use data 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>SLEUTH urban growth model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>started as wildfire spread model
  <li>couples Urban Growth Model (UGM) and Land Cover Deltatron Model (LCD)
  <li>SLEUTH: acronym for inputs:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slope
    <li>Land Cover
    <li>Excluded
    <li>Urban
    <li>Transportation
    <li>Hillshade
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Open source model - many researchers contributed 
</section>

<section>
    <h3>SLEUTH principle</h3>
Urban areas behave like a living organism trained by transition rules:
<ul>
  <li>class to class transition matrix derived from 2 LU maps
  <li>time series of 4 urban maps is used for calibration
  <li>parameters derived from past growth: 
      dispersion, breed, spread, slope resistance, road gravity
  <li>growth types: diffusive, new spreading center, organic, road influenced 
</ul>

    <h3>Probabilistic CA urban growth models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Probabilistic transition rules and a stochastic perturbation term
<li>Statistical methods are used to develop the transition rules, based on past time series
<li>Logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees
</ul>
<p>
New states are generated based on a probabilistic distribution
