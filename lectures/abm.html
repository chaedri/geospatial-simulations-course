    <h3>ABM evolution</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>evolved from cellular automata, game of life
  <li class="fragment">introduces agent acting within an environment
  <li class="fragment">agents move through space across time while interacting with the environment and with each other
  <li class="fragment">in geospatial applications ABM simulates behavior of intelligent agents within a geographic space

    <h3>ABM principle</h3>
<p>
<p>General expression for the agent $A_r (t)$ evolution
<p>
$$
A_r^i (t+\Delta t) = F(A_r^i (t), A_r^j (t), E_r (t), E_r (t+\Delta t), R)
$$
<p>
where $r=(i,j)$ or $(x,y)$ is a location and $t$ is time.
Agent state at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the environment $E_r (t), (t+\Delta t)$ at the location $r$ and its neighborhood
 <li>state of the interacting agent(s) $A_r^j (t)$
 <li>interaction rules $R$
</ul>
<p><small>Space is often tesselated into grid cells $(i,j)$ with initial environmental state $E_r^{t=0}$
Agents are modeled as grid cells or points</small>

    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">autonomous interacting units
<li class="fragment">active features of agents (Crooks et al. 2012): 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">pro-active, reactive, bounded rationality
  <li class="fragment">interaction with other agents and the environment
  <li class="fragment">mobility
  <li class="fragment">adaptation and learning
</ul>
<li class="fragment">population of agents can be heterogeneous
</ul>

    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>Examples
<p class="fragment">Fire modeling: burning cell
<p class="fragment">Disease spread: 
<p class="fragment">Evolution of agropastoral settlements: community / village
<p class="fragment">Movement of people in urban environment: pedestrian

<p>examples of agents and their interactions

    <h3>Compare CA and ABM</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">in CA environment is equivalent to population? $A_i(t) = C_i(t)$ 
 <li class="fragment">ABM treats agents (population) and environment as separate interacting entities
 <li class="fragment">in CA the evolution depends only on the state of the cell neighborhood
 <li class="fragment">ABM the evolution depends on the environment and interaction between agents
 <li class="fragment">ABM the interactions can be long range
<p>
Both CA and ABM capture <strong>emergence and self-organization </strong>

    <h3>Coupling human and natural systems</h3>
<p>Simulating long-term change in socioecological systems: application to prehistoric
Mediterranean societies MedLanD
<ul>
  <li>evolution of landscape: process-based erosion modeling
  <li>land use change driven by agropastoral practicies: stochastic, rule-based model
  <li>alternatively: agent driven land use change
  <li>ABM: agent=farming household

    <h3>ABM of farmed land use evolution</h3>
<p>Simulating long-term change in socioecological systems: application to prehistoric
Mediterranean societies MedLanD
<ul>
  <li>evolution of landscape: process-based erosion modeling
  <li>land use change driven by agropastoral practicies: stochastic, rule-based model
  <li>alternatively: agent driven land use change
  <li>ABM: agent=farming household
</ul>
</section>

<section>
Agents employ decision rules to choose land cells to farm or graze on the basis of their farming returns (calories that affect birth and death rate) and needs (based on household size), the potential productiv- ity of land for agropastoral use (including soil depth and fertility, slope, and current vegetation), and costs to use the land (includ- ing access on foot) (Ullah and Bergin, 2012; Mayer et al., 2006; Mayer and Sarjoughian, 2009; Barton et al., 2010a). As opposed to stochastic modeling of land-use, where cultivated and grazed cells are allocated randomly within catchments whose sizes are esti- mated on the basis of subsistence needs and fallow/grazing cycles, each household agent chooses the best available landscape patches in a round-robin whose order is randomized each execution cycle of the model so that no household will have first access to better lands than other households. Agents also choose land cells from which to collect fuelâ€“wood, based on household size, availability of woody vegetation, and energy costs to access a cell on foot.

    <h3>ABM and modeling of processes</h3>
<p>Discuss disease, urban, and flood modeling and their relation to ABM
<p>Compare the components of disease, urban or flood models to CA and ABM,
how are these models different and what is same?
<p>Can these models be coupled with ABM - which components could be represented by ABM?

  <li>Group 2: ABM, CA and PoPPs
  <li>Group 3: ABM, CA and flooding
