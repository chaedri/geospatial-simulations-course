    <h3>Agent-Based Modeling</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>evolved from cellular automata, game of life
  <li class="fragment">introduces agent acting within an environment
  <li class="fragment">agents move through space across time while interacting with the environment and with each other
  <li class="fragment">in geospatial applications ABM simulates behavior of intelligent agents within a geographic space
</ul>

    <h3>ABM principle</h3>
<p>
<p>General expression for the agent $A_i$ evolution 
<p>
$$
A_i^{t+\Delta t} = F(A_i^t, A_j^t, E^t, R)
$$
<p>
Agent state (location, attributes) at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the interacting agent(s) $A_j^t$
 <li>state of the environment $E$ 
 <li>interaction rules $R$
</ul>
<p><small>Space is often tesselated into grid cells with initial environmental state. 
Agents are modeled as grid cells, patches, oriented lines, or points</small>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Compare CA and ABM</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">in CA environment is equivalent to population
 <li class="fragment">ABM treats agents (population) and environment as separate interacting entities
 <li class="fragment">in CA the evolution depends only on the state of the cell neighborhood
 <li class="fragment">in ABM the evolution depends on the environment and interaction between agents
 <li class="fragment">in ABM the interactions can be long range
<p>
<small>
There is a continuum of models between CA and ABM. Some models can be interpreted as special cases
of solutions to processes, described by partial differential equations: diffusion, fire

    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">autonomous interacting units
<li class="fragment">active features of agents (Crooks et al. 2012): 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">pro-active, reactive, bounded rationality
  <li class="fragment">interaction with other agents and the environment
  <li class="fragment">mobile or stationary
  <li class="fragment">adaptation and learning
</ul>
<li class="fragment">population of agents can be heterogeneous
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>Examples 
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Fire modeling: burning cell
<li class="fragment">Disease spread: bug, virus, or infected people or animals 
<li class="fragment">Evolution of agropastoral settlements: farming household, settlements
<li class="fragment">Movement of animals: individual animal 
<li class="fragment">Movement of people in urban environment: pedestrian
</ul>
Propose interactions

<section>
    <h3>Emergence and self-organization</h3>
<p> Applies to both CA and ABM
<ul>
<li>Emergent behavior: behavior of the modeled system is more complex than the behavior of the parts
<li><small>recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Puffer breeder CA</a></small>
 <li class="fragment">synchronization, cooperation or chaos, turbulence 
 <li class="fragment">self-organization: feedback and adaptive behavior
 <li class="fragment">behavior of a component depends on the behavior of the system
 <li class="fragment">different initial conditions and randomness may lead to different results 
</ul>

<li>Each agent is happy if it has $n%$ of neighbors from the same group
<li>Unhappy agent moves until it finds happy location

    <h3>Coupling human and natural systems</h3>
<p>Simulating long-term change in socioecological systems: application to prehistoric
Mediterranean societies MedLanD
<ul>
  <li>evolution of landscape: process-based erosion and deposition modeling
  <li>land use change driven by agropastoral practicies: stochastic, rule-based model
  <li>alternatively: agent (farming household) driven land use change
</ul>
Stochastic modeling of land-use: cultivated and grazed cells are allocated randomly within catchments 
whose sizes are estimated on the basis of subsistence needs and fallow/grazing cycles. 
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Neolithic farming spread ABM </h3>
<p>Agents employ decision rules to choose land cells to farm or graze based on:
<ul>
 <li>their farming returns (calories that affect birth and death rate)  
 <li>needs (based on household size), 
 <li>the potential productivity of land for agropastoral use (including soil depth and fertility, slope, and current vegetation),
 <li>costs to use the land (including access on foot) 
 <li>each household agent chooses the best available landscape patches 
in a round-robin whose order is randomized each execution cycle of the model so that no household will have first access to better lands than other households. Agents also choose land cells from which to collect fuelâ€“wood, based on household size, availability of woody vegetation, and energy costs to access a cell on foot.
</ul>
Agents initial state and model developemnt is based on archeological record.

<p>Compare the components of disease, urban or flood models to CA and ABM,
