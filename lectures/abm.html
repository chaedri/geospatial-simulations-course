    <h3>ABM evolution</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>started with cellular automata, game of life
  <li class="fragment">introduces agent acting within an environment
  <li class="fragment">agents move through space across time while interacting with the environment and with each other
  <li class="fragment">in geospatial applications ABM simulates behavior of intelligent agents within a geographic space

    <h3>ABM principle</h3>
<p>
<p>General expression for the agent $A_r (t)$ evolution within 
 an environment $E_r (t)$:
<p>
$$
A_r_i^k (t+\Delta t) = F(A_r_i^t, A_r_j^t, E_r_i^{t}, E_r_j^{t}, R)
$$
<p>
where $r=(i,j)$ or $(x,y)$ is a location, $t$ is time
Agent's attribute k at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the environment at the location $r$ and its neighborhood
 <li>state of the interacting agent(s) 
 <li>interaction rules $R$
</ul>
Space is often tesselated into grid cells $(i,j)$ with initial environmental state $E_r^{t=0}$
Agents are modeled as grid cells or points

    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>What are agents?
<p class="fragment">autonomous interacting units

    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>Examples
<p class="fragment">Fire modeling: burning cell
<p class="fragment">Disease spread: 
<p class="fragment">Evolution of agropastoral settlements: community / village
<p class="fragment">Movement of people in urban environment: pedestrian

<p>examples of agents and their interactions

    <h3>Compare CA and ABM</h3>
Cellular automata:
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">in CA environment is equivalent to population? $A_i(t) = C_i(t)$ 
 <li class="fragment">ABM treats agents (population) and environment as separate interacting entities
 <li class="fragment">in CA the evolution depends only on the state of the cell neighborhood
 <li class="fragment">ABM the evolution depends on the environment and interaction between agents
 <li class="fragment">ABM the interactions can be long range
<p>
In CA For the given rules, the resulting pattern is dependent only on the initial configuration:
example of <strong>emergence and self-organization </strong>
In ABM - add

    <h3>Discuss FUTURES and PoPPS components</h3>
group work - look at futures and popps and explain relation of their components to CA and ABM
how are these models different and what is same?
</section>

<section>
    <h3>ABM examples</h3>
<p>Schell segregation model
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Geospatial cellular automata</h3>
<ul>
  <li>initial state is based on land use / land cover data, usually from RS or GIS
  <li>rules are derived from socio-economic data and interactions between humans and environment 
  <li>models are calibrated and validated using time series of land use data 
</ul>

    <h3>SLEUTH urban growth model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>started as wildfire spread model
  <li>couples Urban Growth Model (UGM) and Land Cover Deltatron Model (LCD)
  <li>SLEUTH: acronym for inputs:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slope
    <li>Land Cover
    <li>Excluded
    <li>Urban
    <li>Transportation
    <li>Hillshade
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Open source model - many researchers contributed

    <h3>SLEUTH principle</h3>
Urban areas behave like a living organism trained by transition rules:
<ul>
  <li>class to class transition matrix derived from 2 LU maps
  <li>time series of 4 urban maps is used for calibration
  <li>parameters derived from past growth: 
      dispersion, breed, spread, slope resistance, road gravity
  <li>growth types: diffusive, new spreading center, organic, road influenced 
</ul>

    <h3>Probabilistic CA urban growth models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Probabilistic transition rules and a stochastic perturbation term
<li>Statistical methods are used to develop the transition rules, based on past time series
<li>Logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees
</ul>
<p>
New states are generated based on a probabilistic distribution
