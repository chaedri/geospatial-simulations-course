    <h3>Agent-Based Modeling</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>evolved from cellular automata, game of life
<p>
  <li class="fragment">introduces agent acting within an environment
<p>
  <li class="fragment">agents move through space and across time while interacting with the environment and with each other
<p>
  <li class="fragment">in geospatial applications ABM simulates behavior of intelligent agents within a geographic space
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>ABM principle</h3>
<p>
<p>General expression for the agent $A_i$ evolution 
<p>
$$
A_i^{t+\Delta t} = F(A_i^t, A_j^t, E^t, R)
$$
<p>
Agent state (location, attributes) at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the interacting agent(s) $A_j^t$
 <li>state of the environment $E$ 
 <li>interaction rules $R$
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>ABM space and agents</h3>
<p>Space is often tesselated into grid cells with initial environmental state.
<p>Agents are modeled as grid cells, patches, points or oriented lines

    <h3>Compare CA and ABM</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">in CA environment is equivalent to population
 <li class="fragment">ABM treats agents (population) and environment as separate interacting entities
 <li class="fragment">in CA the evolution depends only on the state of the cell neighborhood
 <li class="fragment">in ABM the evolution depends on the environment and interaction between agents
 <li class="fragment">in ABM the interactions can be long range
<p>
<small>
There is a continuum of models between CA and ABM. Some models can be interpreted as special cases
of solutions to processes described by partial differential equations

<section>
    <h3>Agents and their interaction</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">agents are autonomous interacting units
<li class="fragment">active features of agents (Crooks et al. 2012): 
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">pro-active, reactive, bounded rationality
  <li class="fragment">interaction with other agents and the environment
  <li class="fragment">mobile or stationary
  <li class="fragment">adaptation and learning
</ul>
<p>
<li class="fragment">population of agents can be heterogeneous
</ul>

<li class="fragment">Disease spread: bug, virus, or infected people or animals 
<li class="fragment">Evolution of agropastoral settlements: farming household, settlements
<li class="fragment">Movement of animals: individual animal

<section>
    <h3>Emergence and self-organization</h3>
<p> Applies to both CA and ABM
<ul>
<li>Emergent behavior: behavior of the modeled system is more complex than the behavior of the parts:
recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conways_game_of_life_breeder_animation.gif">Puffer breeder CA</a>
 <li class="fragment">synchronization, cooperation or chaos, turbulence 
 <li class="fragment">self-organization: feedback and adaptive behavior
 <li class="fragment">behavior of a component depends on the behavior of the system
<!-- <li class="fragment">different initial conditions and randomness may lead to different results -->

    <h3>Neolithic farming spread ABM </h3>
<p>Agents employ decision rules to covert land to farming or grazing based on:
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">their farming returns  (affect birth and death rate) 
 <li class="fragment">needs (based on household size), 
 <li class="fragment">the potential productivity of land (soil depth and fertility, slope, current vegetation),
 <li class="fragment">costs to use the land (including access on foot) 
 <li class="fragment">randomized access to the best available land patches
<!-- <li class="fragment"><small>each household agent chooses the best available landscape patches 
in a round-robin whose order is randomized each execution cycle of the model so that no household will have first access to better lands than other households. Agents also choose land cells from which to collect fuel–wood, based on household size, availability of woody vegetation, and energy costs to access a cell on foot.</small>

    <h3>ABM and modeling of processes</h3>
<p>Discuss disease, urban, and flood modeling and their relation to ABM
<p>Compare the components of disease, urban or flood models to CA and ABM,
how are these models different and what is same?
<p>Can these models be coupled with ABM - which components could be represented by ABM?
