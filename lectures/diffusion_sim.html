   <h3>Duality of particles and fields</h3>
<p>Modeled quantities can be represented by
<ul>
  <li>fields - continuous distribution (scalar, vector, tensor)
  <li>particles - discrete sampling of fields
</ul>
<p>Corresponce between the two representations:
<p>density of particles - field $f(r)$
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Duality of particles and fields</h3>
<p>Process can be modeled as
<ul>
  <li>evolution of fields
  <li>evolution of spatially distributed particles
</ul>

   <h3>Monte Carlo methods</h3>
Monte Carlo methods use <b> randomness and statistical estimators</b> 
to solve a variety of problems:
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"> calculations of complicated expressions, eg, multi-variate integrals
  <li class="fragment"> finding approximate solutions of optimization or other problems that are intractable 
by algorithms with polynomial scaling  (eg, can be NP-hard)
  <li class="fragment"> sampling/generating possible scenarios in uncertainty and error propagation studies
  <li class="fragment"> using stochastic processes to simulate processes that can be stochastic, 
 deterministic or a mix of both.

   <h3>Diffusion</h3>
<p>REMOVE THIS SLIDE
<p>Fick's law + mass conservation law lead to diffusion equation
<p>Alternatively, random walks densities evolution is used to derive diffusion equation
<p><small>some definitions
<ul>
<li>flux : rate of mass transport across unit point, line, or area depending on dimension
<li>density gradient: change in density (concentration?)
<li>Fick's law: flux (of particles, material) at a given location is proportional 
to local change (gradient) of (particle) density (or material concentration?)
</ul>
</small>

   <h3>Diffusion equation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Fick's law in 1D:
<br><small>flux $f$ is a function of change in density $n$ (concentration), empirical observation</small>
<p>
$$ f(x,t) = -D_0 {\partial n(x,t) \over \partial x}$$ 
<p>
<li class="fragment"> Continuity equation, mass preservation: 
<br><small>change in density over time at a location =  inflow and outflow of material at this location</small>
<p>
$$ {\partial n(x,t) \over \partial t} + {\partial f(x,t) \over \partial x} = 0 $$
<p>
<li class="fragment"> Diffusion equation: 
<br><small>change in density over time at location $x$ is proportional to change in gradient at this location</small>
<p>
$$ {\partial n(x,t) \over \partial t} = D_0 {\partial^2 n(x,t) \over \partial x^2} $$
<li class="fragment">
<small> $f(x,t)$ is flux, $n(x,t)$ is density, $x$ is location and $t$ is time, D_0 is diffusion constant</small>

   <h3>Fundamental solution </h3>
<ul>
<li>Given a unit impuls $\delta(x-x_0)=n(x,t=0)$ the fundamental solution of 
diffusion equation is 
<p>
<li>
$$ n(x,t) = {1 \over \sqrt{4\pi D_0 t}} e^{{-(x-x_0)^2} \over ({4D_0t)}}$$
<p>
<li class="fragment"> a Gaussian with $ N(x_0, \sigma^2 = 2D_0t) $

   <h3>Green's function for diffusion</h3>
<ul>
<p>We can rewrite the diffusion equation using Green's function
<li>
$$n({\bf r},t+\tau)=\int G_0({\bf r},{\bf r}',\tau)n({\bf r}',t) d{\bf r}'$$
<li>which is evolution equation 
<p>
<li>
and where the Green's function for diffusion equation is the fundamental solution
$$ G_d({\bf r},{\bf r}', \tau) = {1 \over \sqrt{4\pi D_0 \tau}} e^{{-|{\bf r}-{\bf r}'|^2} \over {4D_0\tau}}$$
<p>
</ul>
<p>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Stochastic method of solution</h3>
<ul>
<p>For complex processes which cannot be solved analytically we need numerical solution
<li>
$$n({\bf r},t+\tau)=\int G_0({\bf r},{\bf r}',\tau)n({\bf r}',t) d{\bf r}'$$
<li>which is evolution equation
<p>
<li>
$${\bf r}^{(i)}(\tau)={\bf r}^{(i)}(0)+\vec\eta^{(i)}$$
<li>
where $\eta \elem N(0, \sigma^2 = 2D_0\tau)$
