   <h3>Diffusion equation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>elevation surface: represented by a bivariate function:
<p>
 $$z = f(x,y)$$
<p>
 <li class="fragment">flow over this surface is driven by  <b>surface gradient</b> 
<p>
$$ \nabla f = \left( {\partial f \over \partial x}, {\partial f \over \partial y} \right) = (f_x, f_y)$$
<p>
 <li class="fragment">where $f_x, f_y$ are partial derivatives of $f(x,y)
 <li class="fragment"> $\nabla f$ is a vector in the direction of largest increase in $z$.  
 <li class="fragment">direction and magnitude of flow velocity over complex surface is controled 
by the surface gradient field $\nabla f$.  
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small> note that the direction of flow is minus $\nabla f$, because gradient vector points upslope</small>

   <h3>Diffusion: numerical modeling</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>$- \nabla f$ is a vector in the steepest slope direction (aspect),
  its magnitude is slope steepness (rise over run).
<p>
 <li class="fragment">slope $\beta$ and aspect $\alpha$: 
<p>
$$\beta^\circ = {\arctan}\sqrt{f_x^2+f_y^2} \qquad \beta\%=100 \sqrt{f_x^2+f_y^2}$$
$$\alpha^\circ = {\arccos} \left( -f_y \over \sqrt{f_x^2+f_y^2} \right) $$
<li class="fragment">we can compute gradient using slope and aspect angle 
<p>
$$ f_x = \tan \beta . \cos \alpha, \qquad f_y = \tan \beta . \sin \alpha$$
</ul>
<p>
<small>recall that 
$$(f_x, f_y) = \left( {\partial f \over \partial x}, {\partial f \over \partial y} \right), \; z = f(x,y)$$

  <li class="fragment">Dinf: partial derivatives of a suitable approximation function, such as spline or polynomial
</ul>
<p class="fragment"> <small>Fitting the polynomial bellow to the 9 grid points of 3x3 window
using weighted least squares leads to simple equations for estimating $f_x, f_y$:
<p class="fragment">
$$z(x,y)=a_0+a_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 xy + a_4 x^2 + a_5 y^2$$
<p class="fragment">
$$f_x={{(z_{i-1,j-1}-z_{i+1,j-1})+2(z_{i-1,j}-z_{i+1,j})+(z_{i-1,j+1}-z_{i+1,j+1})} \over {8\Delta x}}$$

<p>The system of equations is closed using the Manning's relation  

$${\bf v}({\bf r},t)= {C\over n({\bf r})} h({\bf r},t)^{2/3} |{\bf s_f}({\bf r},t)|^{1/2} {\bf s_{f0}({\bf r},t)}$$
<ul>
<li>$n({\bf r}) $ is the dimensionless Manning's coefficient,

<li>${\bf s_{f0}}({\bf r})={\bf s_f}({\bf r})/|{\bf s_f}({\bf r})|$
