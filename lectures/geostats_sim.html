    <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>motivation for geostatistical simulations
<li>Geostatistical conditional simulations
<li>Gaussian Sequential Simulation
<li>applications, uncertainty propagation
</ul>

<section>
    <h3>Geostatistical simulations: motivation</h3>
<p>Derive model of spatial distribution of an (environmental) variable
based on a limited set of discrete observations:
<ul>
<li>if the measured data capture the features of the distribution at the level of detail needed
for the application we can use interpolation 
<a href="http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/topics/spatial_interpolation.html">
See GIS582 Spatial interpolation topic</a>
<li>if the measured data are limited and we know statistical properties of the distribution,
we can use simulation
<li>some interpolation methods are based on deterministic, process-based simulations: splines 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Geostatistical simulations: motivation</h3>
<p>
Estimation versus simulation
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">we are modeling complex distribution (e.g. surface)
  <li class="fragment">limited number of samples is available - interpolation does not capture the complexity, the result is too smooth
  <li class="fragment">we know the statistical properties of the complex distribution
  <li class="fragment">we generate many realizations of the surface with the given stats properties
  <li class="fragment">the realizations are used to compute the simulated complex distribution and its uncertainty
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Simulation versus interpolation</h3>
<p>
What is interpolation: predict values at unsampled locations.
<p>Methods
<ul>
<li>see MEA582
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Splines: thin plate simulation</h3>
<p>Splines and simulation
<ul>
<li>see MEA582
</ul>
Physical and geostatistical interpretation of splines
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Geostatistical simulations: applications</h3>
<p>
Observations where sampling is limited:
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">subsurface: reservoir modeling, mining, soil properties, groundwater pollution
  <li class="fragment">surface: variables not detectable by RS, e.g. some pollutants
  <li class="fragment">uncertainty propagation studies
</ul>

<p>Object based: categorical data

<section>
    <h3>Gaussian Sequential Simulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Input: sparse, scattered point measurements
<li>analyze the data for normality - histogram
<li>apply transformation if needed to get normal distribution
<li>Compute semivariogram and its nugget, range and sill
<ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>"Random walk"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Order of grid cells to be simulated
<li>Each realization starts with a different seed, leading to different "random walk"
<li>this is different random walk than what we refered to in path sampling simulations
</ul>

    <h3>Geostatistical simulations with auxiliary data</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">we are modeling complex distribution (e.g. surface)
  <li class="fragment">limited number of samples is available - interpolation does not capture the complexity, the result is too smooth
  <li class="fragment">auxiliary data are available 
  <li class="fragment">we can estimate relation between the auxiliary data and the modeled variable
  <li class="fragment">we use observed data and auxiliary data to simulate the distribution of modeled variable
</ul>

    <h3>ABM principle</h3>
<p>
<p>General expression for the agent $A_i$ evolution 
<p>
$$
A_i^{t+\Delta t} = F(A_i^t, A_j^t, E^t, R)
$$
<p>
Agent state (location, attributes) at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the interacting agent(s) $A_j^t$
 <li>state of the environment $E$ 
 <li>interaction rules $R$
</ul>
<p><small>Space is often tesselated into grid cells with initial environmental state. 
Agents are modeled as grid cells, patches, oriented lines, or points</small>

<section>
    <h3>Emergence and self-organization</h3>
<p> Applies to both CA and ABM
<ul>
<li>Emergent behavior: behavior of the modeled system is more complex than the behavior of the parts
<li><small>recall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Puffer breeder CA</a></small>
 <li class="fragment">synchronization, cooperation or chaos, turbulence 
 <li class="fragment">self-organization: feedback and adaptive behavior
 <li class="fragment">behavior of a component depends on the behavior of the system
 <li class="fragment">different initial conditions and randomness may lead to different results 
</ul>
<p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>ABM and modeling of processes</h3>
<p>Discuss disease, urban, and flood modeling and their relation to ABM
<p>Compare the components of disease, urban or flood models to CA and ABM,
how are these models different and what is same?
<p>Can these models be coupled with ABM - which components could be represented by ABM?

<ul>
  <li>Group 1: ABM, CA and FUTURES
  <li>Group 2: ABM, CA and PoPPs
  <li>Group 3: ABM, CA and flooding
</ul>
