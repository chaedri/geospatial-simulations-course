    <h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>motivation for geostatistical simulations
<li>physics-based surface simulation and splines
<li>geostatistical conditional simulations
<li>Gaussian Sequential Simulation
<li>simulations for uncertainty propagation
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Derive model of spatial distribution of a variable
based on a limited set of discrete scattered observations:
<ul>
<li class="fragment">if the measured data capture features of the distribution at the level of detail needed
for the application we can use interpolation 
<br><small><a href="http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/topics/spatial_interpolation.html">
See GIS582 Spatial interpolation topic</a></small>
<li class="fragment">if the measured data are limited and we know statistical properties of the distribution,
we can use simulation
<li class="fragment">some interpolation methods are based on deterministic, process-based simulations: splines 
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Problem formulation</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Given the $m$ values of a studied phenomenon $z_j$ measured
at locations ${\bf r}_j=(x_j,y_j), \; j=1,\dots ,m$ 
find a function $F({\bf r})$ which fulfils the following condition:
<p>
$$ F({\bf r}_j)=z_j,\quad j=1,\ldots ,m $$
<li class="fragment">The problem does not have a unique solution so additional conditions are used.
<li class="fragment">Interpolation: we use $F({\bf r}_j)$ to estimate values at unsampled locations
<li class="fragment">Simulation: we use $F({\bf r}_j)$ to condition our simulation of a more complex surface
</ul>

<img height="340px" src="img/geostats/elevrandpts.jpg">
<img height="340px" src="img/geostats/pointstogrid.jpg">
<p>
<small>Interpolation: distance between grid points is similar to the average distance between the given points
<p>Simulation: distance between grid points can be much smaller - higher resolution grid
</small>

    <h3>Splines with tension</h3>
<p>
<p>Splines with tension simulate the behavior of a thin plate with tuneable properties 
<p>
$$
F({\bf r})=T({\bf r})+\sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_j R({\bf r},{\bf r}_j)\, 
$$
<p> <small>
<ul> 
<li>$T({\bf r})$ is a trend function, 
<li>$\lambda_j$ are weights (coefficients) 
<li>$R({\bf r},{\bf r}_j)$ is a function of distance between an unsampled and a measured point. 
<li>$R$ is derived by minimizing the smoothness seminorm (or roughness penalty)
</ul>
<p>
Bivariate smoothness seminorm with weighted squares of
first and second derivatives leads to
<strong>thin plate spline with tension </strong>, when all derivatives
are used with decreasing weight we get
<strong>regularized spline with tension </strong>. We minimize curvatures / energy of the surface.
</small>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Splines with tension</h3>
<p><small>Thin plate spline with tension is then
$$
F({\bf r})=a_0 + \sum_{j=1}^N \lambda_j 
\left[ {\rm K_0} (\varphi r/2) + \ln(\varphi r/2) + C \right] 
$$
where $K_0(.)$ is the Bessel function and $\varphi$ is tension parameter,
$C$ is constant. The function simulates a flexible thin steel plate (low tension) 
through rubber sheet (high tension).

    <h3>Geostatistical simulations</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">modeled spatial distribution is complex
  <li class="fragment">limited number of samples is available 
   - interpolation does not capture the complexity, result is too smooth
  <li class="fragment">we have some knowledge of statistical properties of the modeled distribution
  <li class="fragment">we generate many realizations of the surface using the given statistical properties
  <li class="fragment">the realizations are used to compute the simulated distribution mean and uncertainty maps
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
Observations where sampling is limited:
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">subsurface: reservoir modeling in petroleum industry, mining, 
   soil properties, groundwater pollution
  <li class="fragment">surface: variables not detectable by RS, e.g. some pollutants
  <li class="fragment">generate multiple realizations of modeled distribution for uncertainty propagation studies
</ul>

<section>
    <h3>Generate one realization</h3>
<ul>
<li>assign data points to closest grid cell (nearest neighbor point binning)
<li>select random unsampled grid location and compute kriged estiamte + random residual to get simulated value
using the neighboring given points
<li>use "random path" to define order of empty grid cells to be simulated
<li>at each new unsampled grid location use the nearby given points and previously simulated values 
to compute the simulated values
</ul>
<p><small>this is different random walk than what we refered to in path sampling simulations</small>

<section>
    <h3>Compute mean and uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each realization starts with a different seed
<li>Compute hundreds or thousands realizations
<li>Mean is the simulated distribution result 
</ul>

    <h3>ABM principle</h3>
<p>
<p>General expression for the agent $A_i$ evolution 
<p>
$$
A_i^{t+\Delta t} = F(A_i^t, A_j^t, E^t, R)
$$
<p>
Agent state (location, attributes) at time $t+\Delta t$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the interacting agent(s) $A_j^t$
 <li>state of the environment $E$ 
 <li>interaction rules $R$
</ul>
<p><small>Space is often tesselated into grid cells with initial environmental state. 
Agents are modeled as grid cells, patches, oriented lines, or points</small>
