   <h3>Geospatial simulations</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial simulations: the modeled quantities are function of a location on Earth
<li class="fragment">Using modeling to simulate complex spatial processes or behaviors 
under designed set of conditions to gain understanding of the studied phenomenon
<li class="fragment">Diagnostic and predictive modeling
<li class="fragment">Provide information for decision making
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial process models</h3>
<p>Geospatial process models are core tools for simulations.
<p>The models of geophysical, biological and socio-economic processes 
have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: <b>empirical, spatially averaged, and static</b>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: <b>process-based, distributed, and dynamic </b>with
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
 <p class="fragment">Most models combine both approaches
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI) 
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: Universal Soil Loss Equation - factors are based on observations, 
but topographic LS factor also represents a special case of stream power </small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">derived from first principles, based on physical laws, 
such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">can simulate the process under conditions not previously observed
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><small>Example: surface water flow model is based on St. Venant equation, 
but uses empirical Mannings coefficient for computing flow velocity</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
When performing simulations we need to consider:
<p>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Modeled quantity [units]:</b> water, pollutant, vegetation, population density, individual organism, ... 
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Spatial and temporal scale</b>
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Configuration space and interactions:</b> modeled quantity as function of environmental variables, e.g., topography, land cover, infrastructure... 
  <li class="fragment"> <b>Governing equations or rules:</b> continuity, mass preservation, diffusion, ...
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components example</h3>
Show as images
<ul>
  <li>Modeled quantity [units]: <b>water depth [m]</b>, 
  <li>Spatial and temporal scale: <b>first order stream watershed, 1m resolution, 3 hours at 1 min time step)</b> 
  <li>Configuration space and interactions: <b>water depth as dependent on topography, soil properties, land cover, infrastructure...</b>
  <li>Governing equations or rules:<b> bivariate shallow water flow equation, mannings equation, ... </b>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
 Modeled quantities and environmental variables can be represented by continuous georeferenced fields 
<p>To support numerical simulations these fields need to be discretized: 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially averaged units:</b> discrete polygons (hydrologic units, hillslope elements, landscape patches) 
  <li class="fragment"><b>spatially distributed representation:</b> structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles 
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Modeled quantities can also evolve along networks or represent discrete objects (particles, agents)</p>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Spatially averaged models predict the modeled variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number
 <li>Provide important agreggated information for decision making
</ul>
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict 
the variable at any point in space and the result is continuous field
<li>Results may be spatially averaged and classified to support decision making
</ul>
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Coupled models for simulations of complex systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Continuous time simulations of coupled processes
<li>Coupled models challenges: different spatial and temporal scales, discretization
<li>Examples: SWAT, WEPP: weather, runoff, infiltration, crop growth, soil erosion, pollutant transport
<li>Coupled agent based models and continuous field models for complex human - nature systems simulations
</ul>

   <h3>Static and dynamic models</h3>
<p>Empirical, statistical models - usually steady state
<p>Process-based or hybrid models - capture dynamic processes

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial simulations challenges</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">data intensive - large heterogeneous data sets
 <li class="fragment">complex, multiscale spatial interactions
 <li class="fragment">high level of uncertainty and difficult validation
 <li class="fragment">input and validation data may not available at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution 
 <li class="fragment">process-based distributed models do not always improve accuracy but they provide important insight 
</ul>
<p><small>Physics : predictions at the electronic level are with 6-12 digits accuracy 
<br>Geosciences: 70% differences between measurements and model could be satisfactory</small>
<br> <small>Example: we cannot predict rainfall rate at each 100m cell with high accuracy and
we donâ€™t have values of initial soil moisture at sufficient temporal resolution, 
so it is difficult to accurately model infiltration, runoff or sediment flow at any point in space </small>

results analysis and visualization, but the model is independent from GIS.
