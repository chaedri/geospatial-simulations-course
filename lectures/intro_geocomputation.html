   <h3>Geospatial modeling of processes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>
<li>Geospatial simulations: the modeled quantities are function of a location on Earth
<li>Geospatial models have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: empirical, spatially averaged, static 
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: process-based, distributed, dynamic with 
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
</ul>
 <p class="fragment">Most models combine several approaches
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical and process-based models</h3>
<p class="fragment"><b>Empirical:</b>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
</ul>
<p class="fragment"><b>Process-based</b>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">based on physical laws, such as continuity and mass conservation equations 
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations,
physics based equations often have empirical parameters
<p class="fragment">ML, AI - empirical approach
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
<p>
Modeled quantity: water, sediment, pollutant 
<p>
Configuration space and interactions: modeled quantity as function of environmental variables (topography, land cover, ...)
<p>
Governing equations: continuity, mass preservation ...
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
 Modeled quantities are usually represented by continuous georeferenced fields 
<p class="fragment">To support numerical modeling the fields are discretized: 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">spatially averaged units: polygons (hydrologic units, subwatersheds, hillslope elements) - complex geometrical shape is replaced by tilted plane 
  <li class="fragment">spatially distributed representation: structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles 
</ul>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
Spatially averaged models predict the variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
<p>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict 
the variable at any point in space, the result is continuous field
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Static and dynamic models</h3>
<p>Empirical, statistical models - usually steady state
<p>Process-based or hybrid models - capture dynamic processes
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial modeling challenges</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>data intensive - large heterogeneous data sets
 <li>complex, multiscale spatial interactions
 <li>high level of uncertainty and difficult validation
</ul>
<p><small>Physics : predictions at the electronic level are with 6-12 digits accuracy 
Geosciences: 50% differences between measurements and model could be satisfactory</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling of processes in GIS</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">workflow using GIS tools: simple empirical models with physics based components 
<li class="fragment">models fully integrated as modules: complex physics-based or empirical models
<li class="fragment">models linked to GIS as extensions or add-ons: common structure and interface
<li class="fragment">complex modeling systems linked through data: GIS is used for input data processing, 
results analysis and visualization, but the model is independent from GIS.
<li class="fragment">complex modeling systems can incorporate selected GIS capabilities
</ul>
