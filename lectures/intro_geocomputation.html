   <h3>Geospatial simulations</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Numerical simulations: tools for gaining new knowledge - <b>virtual experiments</b>
<li class="fragment">Geospatial simulations: the modeled quantities are function of a location on Earth
<li class="fragment">Using modeling to simulate complex processes or behaviors under designed set of conditions to gain understanding of the studied phenomenon
<li class="fragment">Provide information for decision making
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial models</h3>
Geospatial models have evolved:
<ul>
<p>
 <li class="fragment">from: empirical, spatially averaged, and static
<p>
 <li class="fragment">to: process-based, distributed, and dynamic with
     the aim to predict modeled quantity at any point in space and time
</ul>
 <p class="fragment">Most models combine both approaches
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Empirical models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">statistical models derived from experimental or observed data
 <li class="fragment">applicable only to landscapes under same conditions
 <li class="fragment">empirical / statistical methods often have physics based interpretations
 <li class="fragment">given sufficient data they can be very accurate (ML, AI) 
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Examples: USLE - factors based on observations, but LS factor also represents stream power .... LINKS, IMGs?
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Process-based models</h3>
<ul>
 <li class="fragment">based on physical laws, such as continuity and mass conservation equations
 <li class="fragment">many are refered to as mechanistic or deterministic models
 <li class="fragment">may include stochastic components
 <li class="fragment">physics based equations often have empirical parameters
</ul>
<p class="fragment">Examples: surface water flow (St. Venant equation, but empirical Mannings coefficient
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling components</h3>
When performing simulations we need to consider:
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Modeled quantity: water, pollutant, development (population density), individual organism, .. 
  <li> Configuration space: modeled quantity as function of environmental variables (topography, land cover, ...) 
  <li> Interactions
  <li> Governing equations or rules: continuity, mass preservation ...
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial representation</h3>
<p>
 Modeled quantities are usually represented by continuous georeferenced fields 
<p class="fragment">To support numerical modeling the fields are discretized: 
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">spatially averaged units: polygons (hydrologic units, subwatersheds, hillslope elements) - complex geometrical shape is replaced by tilted plane 
  <li class="fragment">spatially distributed representation: structured and unstructured meshes, or random particles 
</ul>

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially averaged models</h3>
Spatially averaged models predict the variable for each averaged unit, such as watershed,
the result is discrete polygons or a number

</section>

<section>
   <h3>Spatially distributed models</h3>
<p>Spatially distributed or spatially explicit models predict 
the variable at any point in space, the result is continuous field
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Static and dynamic models</h3>
<p>Empirical, statistical models - usually steady state
<p>Process-based or hybrid models - capture dynamic processes
<p> <img height="330" src="img/flow_erosion/aspectarrows.png">
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Geospatial modeling challenges</h3>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>data intensive - large heterogeneous data sets
 <li>complex, multiscale spatial interactions
 <li>high level of uncertainty and difficult validation
</ul>
<p><small>Physics : predictions at the electronic level are with 6-12 digits accuracy 
Geosciences: 50% differences between measurements and model could be satisfactory</small>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Modeling of processes in GIS</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">workflow using GIS tools: simple empirical models with physics based components 
<li class="fragment">models fully integrated as modules: complex physics-based or empirical models
<li class="fragment">models linked to GIS as extensions or add-ons: common structure and interface
<li class="fragment">complex modeling systems linked through data: GIS is used for input data processing, 
results analysis and visualization, but the model is independent from GIS.
<li class="fragment">complex modeling systems can incorporate selected GIS capabilities
</ul>
