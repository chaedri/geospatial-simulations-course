   <h3>Modeling diffusion, flow, transport</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Recall diffusion equation: 
<br><small>change in density over time at location $x$ is proportional to change in gradient at this location
<p>
$$ {\partial n(x,t) \over \partial t} = D_0 {\partial^2 n(x,t) \over \partial x^2} $$
<li>
$n(x,t)$ is density, $x$ is location and $t$ is time, D_0 is diffusion constant</small>
</ul>
<ul>
<!-- change x to bold r=(x,y)-->
<li class="fragment"> Diffusion in geomorphology: long-term landscape evolution
<br><small>change in elevation over time at $x$ is proportional to change in gradient at $x$
<p>
$$ {\partial z(x,t) \over \partial t} = U - \kappa \nabla q_s(x,t) = U - \kappa {\partial^2 z(x,t) \over \partial x^2} $$
<li>
$q_s(x,t)$ = \kappa \nabla$ is flux, $z(x,t)$ is elevation, $x$ is location and $t$ is time, \kappa is diffusion constant</small>
</ul>
<p>What is second order derivative of elevation field?
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Fundamental solution </h3>
<ul>
<li>Given a unit impuls $\delta(x-x_0)=n(x,t=0)$ the fundamental solution of 
diffusion equation is 
<p>
<li>
$$ n(x,t) = {1 \over \sqrt{4\pi D_0 t}} e^{{-(x-x_0)^2} \over ({4D_0t)}}$$
<p>
<li> a Gaussian with $ N(x_0, \sigma^2 = 2D_0t) $
<li>solutions for the rest require numerical approach, but special cases have explicit solutions
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Green's function, path sampling solutions </h3>
<ul>
<p>We can rewrite the diffusion equation using Green's function
<li>
$$n({\bf r},t+\tau)=\int G_0({\bf r},{\bf r}',\tau)n({\bf r}',t) d{\bf r}'$$
<li>which is evolution equation 
<p>
<li>
and where the Green's function for diffusion equation is the fundamental solution
$$ G_d({\bf r},{\bf r}',\delta t) = {1 \over \sqrt{4\pi D_0 t}} e^{{-({\bf r}-{\bf r}')^2} \over {4D_0t)}}$$
<p>
<li>
</ul>
<p>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Stochastic method of solution</h3>
<ul>
<p>For complex processes which cannot be solved analytically we need numerical solution
<li>
$$n({\bf r},t+\tau)=\int G_0({\bf r},{\bf r}',\tau)n({\bf r}',t) d{\bf r}'$$
<li>which is evolution equation
<p>
<li>
$${\bf r}^{(i)}(\tau)={\bf r}^{(i)}(0)+\vec\eta^{(i)}$$
<p>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Diffusion with drift</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>This describes diffusion in a medium which {\it drifts} with
constant velocity ${\bf v}_0$.  GF:
$$
G_d(...)={1 \over (4\pi t)^{3/2}} 
e^{- |{\bf r}-{\bf r}'-{\bf v}_0t|^2/4t}
$$
<li>Of course, this process can be also simulated by sampling.  The walk will propagate as
$$
{\bf r}^{(i)}(t+\tau)={\bf r}^{(i)}(t)+{\bf v}_0\tau + \vec\eta^{(i)}
$$
<li>where ...
</ul>
</section>

<section>
   <h3>Diffusion with drift and proliferation / decay</h3>
<p><small>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of a constant proliferation/decay term $U_0$:
$$
[\partial n({\bf r},t) /\partial t - \nabla_{\bf r}^2n({\bf r},t)
+\nabla\cdot(n({\bf r},t){\bf v}_0) +U_0 n({\bf r},t)]=0
$$
<li>Disregard for a moment the diffusion and drift terms so that the equation simplifies to
$$
{\partial  n({\bf r},t)) \over \partial t} = -U_0n({\bf r},t)
$$
<li>This reminds us of a rate process, for which we have
 $n({\bf r},t)\propto \exp(-U_0t)$. Enlightened by this insight we can write
$$
G({\bf r},{\bf r}',t)= e^{-U_0t}G_d(...)
$$
<li>How could this be captured by the sampling process ? We need to
introduce the walker {\it weight} which records how much of it has survived 
or how much it has gained in time.  The walker weight will evolve as
$$
w^{(i)}(t+\tau)=w^{(i)}(t)e^{-\tau U_0} 
$$
<li>Note that this is multiplicative as it is in GF and assuming
positive $U_0$, the walks diminish exponentially quickly in time and 
the solution will be given by
$$
n({\bf r},t)={\rm distr}
[\{
w^{(i)}(t)\delta({\bf r}-{\bf r}^{(i)}(t))
\}_{i=1}^{M_{walk}}]+\epsilon_{stat}
$$
</ul>
