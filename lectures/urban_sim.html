    <h3>Cellular automata principle</h3>
<p>
Space is tesselated into grid cells with initial state $C_{i,j}^{t=0}$
<p>State of cell $(i,j)$ at time $t+\Delta t$ can be expressed as:
<p>
$$
C_{ij}^{t+\Delta t} = F(C_{ij}^{t}, O_{ij}^{t}, R)
$$
<p>where
<ul>
 <li>$C_{ij}^{t}$ is the cell state at time $t$, 
 <li>$O_{ij}^{t}$ is the state of cells in its neighborhood
 <li>$R$ represents transition rules 
 <li>note that $\Delta t$ is small 
</ul>

    <h3>Game of life</h3>
<p>Developed by Conway in 1970, the game has the following simple rules:
<small>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  <li class="fragment">Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  <li class="fragment">Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  <li class="fragment">Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
</ul>
</small>
<p class="fragment">
The resulting pattern is dependent only on the initial configuration:
example of <strong>emergence and self-organization </strong> leading to many
surprising evolution patterns

    <h3>Geospatial cellular automata</h3>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">initial state is based on land use / land cover data, usually from RS or GIS
  <li class="fragment">rules are derived from socio-economic data and interactions between humans and environment 
  <li class="fragment">models are calibrated and validated using time series of land use data 
</ul>

    <h3>SLEUTH urban growth model</h3>
<ul>
<!--  <li>started as wildfire spread model-->
  <li>couples Urban Growth Model (UGM) and Land Cover Deltatron Model (LCD)
  <li>SLEUTH is an acronym for inputs:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Slope
    <li>Land Cover
    <li>Excluded
    <li>Urban
    <li>Transportation
    <li>Hillshade
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
Open source model - many researchers contributed

    <h3>SLEUTH principle</h3>
Urban areas behave like a living organism trained by transition rules:
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">class to class transition matrix derived from 2 LU maps
  <li class="fragment">time series of 4 urban maps is used for calibration
  <li class="fragment">parameters derived from past growth: dispersion, breed, spread, slope resistance, road gravity
  <li class="fragment">growth types: diffusive, new spreading center, organic, road influenced 
</ul>
