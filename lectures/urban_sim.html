    <h3>Cellular automata principle</h3>
<p>
Space is tesselated into grid cells $(i,j)$ (usually square) with initial state $C_{i,j}^{t=0}$
<p>General expression for the cell state evolution:
$$
C_{ij}^{t+1} = F(C_{ij}^{t}, O_{ij}^{t}, R)
$$
State of cell $(i,j)$ at time $t+1$ is a function of 
<ul>
 <li>its state at time $t$, 
 <li>state of the cells in its neighborhood or more general impact of its neighborhood $O_{ij}^{t}$
 <li>transition rules $R$
</ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Game of life example</h3>
<p>Rules:
<ul>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
</ul>
For the given rules, the resulting pattern is dependent only on the initial configuration:
example of emergence and self-organization

    <h3>Game of life example</h3>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of life in wikipedia</a>: from simple 
still lifes and oscilators to complex and surprising evolution (e.g. play puffer-type breeder)
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Geospatial cellular automata</h3>
<ul>
  <li>initial state is based on land use / land cover data, usually from RS or GIS
  <li>rules are derived from socio-economic data 
  <li>models can be calibrated and validated used past time series
</ul>

    <h3>Rule-based CA urban growth models</h3>
<p>SLEUTH principle
couples urban growth model and land cover model

<p>SLEUTH application examples: China, Iran

    <h3>Probabilistic CA urban growth models</h3>
<ul>
<li>Probabilistic transition rules and a stochastic perturbation term
<li>Statistical methods are used to develop the transition rules, based on past time series
<li>Logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees
</ul>
New states are generated based on a probabilistic distribution
