<h3>Course web site and Moodle</h3>
    Assignment reports, presentations and the final paper are submitted through 
    <a class="term-changes" href="https://moodle-courses1920.wolfware.ncsu.edu/course/view.php?id=5496"><b>Moodle</b></a>
    where feedback and grades will be posted following the submission. 
    Help is provided through Moodle forum

<h3>Lectures</h3>
Focus of lectures is on principles, theory, concepts, methods and lectures are mostly software independent.

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
There are several assignments based on the hands-on exercises. The assignments require
independent work including data processing, visualization, and scientific
writing, beyond what is covered in the lecture portion of the course.

<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
Course focus will be on using and developing for open source software. Several assignments will be performed using
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">GRASS GIS</a>, see GIS582 
     <a href="http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/logistics.html"><b>Course logistics</b></a>
     web page for details on download and installation
 <li>Python and/or R, optionally landlab 
</ul>
Additional information about software will be provided with the individual assignments.

<h4 id="data">Data</h4>
Links to data are provided on the assignment webpages. Instructions for downloading the educational
GRASS GIS dataset are on the GIS582 
<a href="http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/logistics.html"><b>Course logistics</b></a> web page.

<h4>Assignment reports</h4>
<ul>
    <li>For each topic (as indicated in the schedule) you will submit a brief paper
    with min. 800 word text and 2 or more pages of graphics</li>

              In this section you should demonstrate that for the given step-by-step instructions
              your were able to explain what methods are being used to solve the given problem</li>
            <li>Results: maps, graphs, tables with comments, focus on what is interesting in the data
                  and the derived maps, how does the method used influence the results.
                  Include answers to questions in this section. Post 4-6 images per page.</li>
            <li>Discussion: was there anything unexpected or problematic in the results?
                          Were there any issues related to the methdology? Also discuss the software issues,
                          including fixes and suggestions for improvements here.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: 1-2 sentences what you have learned</li>
