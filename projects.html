<h2>Projects</h2>
Throughout the semester, the students will develop and
implement a geospatial simulation tool relevant for their dissertation research.
First, students will identify a research question that
requires simulation of geospatial process or phenomena and exploration of system behavior under a selected set of
conditions. Second, students will develop a methodological workflow and identify the appropriate
programming tools for implementation. The project results will be presented to the
rest of the class and summarized in a short sceintific paper. Documentation of the simulation tool and a live
demonstration will be required. The final design will be judged on methodological rigor, creativity, and presentation.
