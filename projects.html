<h3>Paper requirements</h3>
<p>Structure and formatting should follow scientific journal standards.
Please read and follow <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/connect/11-steps-to-structuring-a-science-paper-editors-will-take-seriously"> 11 steps to structuring a science paper</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Text: minimum 4 pages, single spaced including tables and references</li>
<li>Figures: mininmum 2 pages, images, maps, graphs, all should have readable size, scale and legends where needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Organization of the paper
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Introduction/Background: brief literature review, motivation for the research, research question / objective</li>
    <li>Study site: where, why, geographic characteristics</li>
    <li>Data: sources, don't forget to discuss selection of resolutions, spatial extent</li>
    <li>Methods: describe methodology, highlight any new approach that you have developed </li>
    <li>Results and discussion: present and explain the qualitative and quantitative results,
        including tables, graphs, maps/images;
        compare with results from other studies (confirmed previously observed phenomena, showed something new,
        which questions remain unresolved</li>
    <li>Conclusion: summary of the most important findings including advances in methodology, future work</li>
    <li>References
    <li>Appendix: link to github, workflows, commands, scripts, metadata, software-specific issues</li>
    <li>Optional: Jupyter notebook, data repository, online tool</li>
</ul>

Further notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Use scientific language </li>
    <li>Spelling errors are unacceptable</li>
    <li>Images: make sure the figures are readable, use well designed color ramps, add scale bar and legends</li>
  </ul>
<!--
Throughout the semester, the students will develop and
implement a geospatial computing or simulation tool relevant for their dissertation research.
First, students will identify a research question that
requires geospatial computing or simulation of geospatial process or phenomena 
and exploration of system behavior under a selected set of conditions. 
Second, students will develop a methodological workflow and identify the appropriate
programming tools for implementation. The project results will be presented to the
rest of the class and summarized in a short scientific paper. Documentation of 
the geocomputing or simulation tool and a live demonstration will be required. 
The final design will be judged on methodological rigor, creativity, and presentation.

<p>
The following project assignments will be required:
<ul>
  <li>proposal (min 2 pages)
  <li>project progress lightning talk (5 min)
  <li>project presentation (15 min) 
  <li>paper (min 4 pages, Jupyter notebook optional)
</ul>

In addition to the required submissions, the students are encouraged to submit draft 
papers according to the schedule to recieve feedback on their progress, research direction
and writing. Information about targetted scientific journal should be included.
