<h2>Projects</h2>
Throughout the semester, the students will develop and
implement a geospatial computing or simulation tool relevant for their dissertation research.
First, students will identify a research question that
requires geospatial computing or simulation of geospatial process or phenomena 
and exploration of system behavior under a selected set of conditions. 
Second, students will develop a methodological workflow and identify the appropriate
programming tools for implementation. The project results will be presented to the
rest of the class and summarized in a short scientific paper. Documentation of 
the geocomputing or simulation tool and a live demonstration will be required. 
The final design will be judged on methodological rigor, creativity, and presentation.

<p>
The following project assignments will be required:
<ul>
  <li>proposal (min 2 pages)
  <li>project progress lightning talk (5 min)
  <li>project presentation (15 min) 
  <li>paper (min 4 pages, Jupyter notebook optional)
</ul>

In addition to the required submissions, the students are encouraged to submit draft 
papers according to the schedule to recieve feedback on their progress, research direction
and writing. Information about targetted scientific journal should be included.
