Work on the project results and record project presentation
<ul>
  <li>To record your presentation, you can use 
  <a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcaster Software,</a>
  see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/183231/how-to-record-your-desktop-and-create-a-screencast-on-windows/">tutorial),</a> 
  <a href="https://www.screencastify.com/">Screencastify</a>, 
  MS Powerpoint, Libre Office, or any other software with similar recording functionality. 
  Do NOT submit recordings in SWF format (it's not supported on many systems for security reasons).
  <li>Post the presentation on Moodle site, or, if the file is too big, upload your file to Google drive and share it with the instructors. Keep the presentation to 10 minutes and name your file LastnameFirstname_Presentation.mp4, LastnameFirstname_Presentation.pptx (or whatever format you use).
  <li>Recorded presentations are due April 28.
